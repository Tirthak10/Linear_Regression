# Linear_Regression
This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression** model in Python to predict energy consumption based on temperature data. Utilizing libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**, it begins with data loading and exploration, followed by training a linear regression model where temperature serves as the independent variable and energy consumption as the dependent variable. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²), complemented by visualizations that depict the regression line against actual data points. This educational tool is designed for users interested in data analysis and machine learning, providing a hands-on experience through an interactive Jupyter Notebook.
